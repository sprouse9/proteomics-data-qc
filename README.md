## ðŸ”Ž Results

- The TIC plot above shows the intensity of ions detected across the retention time of the LC-MS run.
- Look for features such as:
  - Consistent baseline signal across the run.
  - Well-defined peaks indicating peptide elution.
  - Absence of long periods of low or zero signal (which can indicate injection or LC issues).

## âœ… Conclusions

- The successful download and visualization of raw proteomics data demonstrates basic competency with proteomics data formats and quality control practices.
- This analysis provides a starting point for deeper workflows, such as peptide identification and quantitative analysis, or integration with machine learning pipelines.
